# Delivery Time Prediction (Regression System)

This project implements an end-to-end **regression pipeline** to predict delivery time based on order, distance, and operational features. The goal is to demonstrate practical modeling decisions, feature engineering, and evaluation for real-world regression problems.

---

## Problem Statement
Accurately predicting delivery time is critical for logistics and customer experience. This project formulates delivery-time estimation as a supervised regression problem and evaluates multiple models to balance accuracy and interpretability.

---

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Regression modeling and evaluation
- Error analysis and model comparison

---

## Models Used
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Regularized Regression (Ridge / Lasso)
- Tree-based models (if applicable)

---

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Residual analysis

---

## Key Learnings
- Importance of feature scaling and outlier handling
- Bias–variance trade-offs in regression
- Interpretable vs high-capacity models

---
